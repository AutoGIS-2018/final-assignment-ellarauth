Thus IF the user has specified two travel modes (passed in as a list) for the AccessViz, the tool will calculate the time/distance difference of those travel modes into a new data column that should be created in the Shapefile. The logic of the calculation is following the order of the items passed on the list where first travel mode is always subtracted by the last one: travelmode1 - travelmode2. The tool should ensure that distances are not compared to travel times and vice versa. If the user chooses to compare travel modes to each other, you should add the travel modes to the filename such as Accessibility_5797076_pt_vs_car.shp. If the user has not specified any travel modes, the tool should only create the Shapefile but not execute any calculations. It should be only possible to compare two travel modes between each other at the time. Accepted travel modes are the same ones that are found in the actual TravelTimeMatrix file (pt_r_tt, car_t, etc.). If the user specifies something else, stop the program, and give advice what are the acceptable values."
